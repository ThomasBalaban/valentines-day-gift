        <h1>~Happy Late Valentine's Day~</h1>
        </center>
        <p>I just wanted to say how much I really appreciate you as a person, and that <strong>I love you very much.</strong></p>
        <p>I know that this isn't very much, but I tried to make something cute for you.</p>
        <p>I am really excited for tonight, and this might be a crappy Valentine's Day gift, but I was going to give this file (if it hopfully works) and I was going to be 100% honest the whole night.</p>
        <p>Being honest probably sounds like a half assed gift, but it is hard for me to just tell people what I feel most of the time.</p>
        <p>I want to be better to you then I have been, becuase you deserve better.</p>
        <p>I just want you to know that you are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compassionate</li>
            <li>Sweet</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>Sexy</li>
            <li>Handsome</li>
            <li>Hella smart</li>
            <li>The best because now I can send you dumb shit like this cause you taught me how to code</li>
            <li>A great person to be around</li>
        <p>I made the background a cute green color cause I know you like green</p>
        </ul>
